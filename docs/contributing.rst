Where to start?
===============

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements,
enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

If you are brand new to *sgkit* or open-source development, we recommend going
through the `GitHub "issues" tab <https://github.com/pystatgen/sgkit/issues>`_
to find issues that interest you. There are a number of issues listed under
`documentation <https://github.com/pystatgen/sgkit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adocumentation>`_
and `good first issue
<https://github.com/pystatgen/sgkit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_
where you could start out.

There are also discussions on the `Software, Methods, and Data for Statistical Genetics forum
<https://discourse.smadstatgen.org/>`_, which tend to be about higher-level themes. Coding details are
discussed on GitHub issues and pull requests.

Contributing your changes to *sgkit*
